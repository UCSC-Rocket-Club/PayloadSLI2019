# Payload SLI 2019

## Summary
This is the code for deployment of the Payload for NASA's 2019 SLI Payload challenge. During flight, at approximately 400 feet, we will remotely trigger separation of the payload section via radio; and later trigger release of the drone. 

We are using the (Adafruit Feather LoRa 32u4 (RFM9x) with the RadioHead (RFM9x) library)[https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-32u4-radio-with-lora-radio-module/using-the-rfm-9x-radio]. 


## Rules for this repo and Payload code in general
* Use branches and PRs -- this way we can do code reviews and learn git the proper way
* Write clean code
* Heavily comment your code, so that it's easier for people who aren't familiar with C/C++/coding in general to understand it
* Make flowcharts (with proper conventions)[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming_Fundamentals/Flowcharts] for the code you write so we can A) help visualize it and B) put in documents
* DO NOT SEND CODE OVER SLACK/IMESSAGE/FB
