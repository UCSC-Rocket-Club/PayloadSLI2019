# Payload SLI 2019

## Summary
This is the code for deployment of the Payload for NASA's 2019 SLI Payload challenge. During flight, at approximately 400 feet, we will remotely trigger separation of the payload section via radio; and later trigger release of the drone. 

We are using the (Adafruit Feather LoRa 32u4 (RFM9x) with the RadioHead (RFM9x) library)[https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-32u4-radio-with-lora-radio-module/using-the-rfm-9x-radio].
